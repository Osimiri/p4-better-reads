// dont think that we need a component for userbooks, since theyll be rendered after sorting 
// dont think we need genre compnonent since genres link to backend will just be used for sorting i think
// whats difference intended for BookPage vs Render Book component
// I think book is for how each individual book will render on a card 
// but book page is the container they would all live in 

//I wasnt sure, i thought they would be the same thing 
//we can delete 
//so kinda like how pokemon searcher was like?
//yuh
//but we can go ahead and delete genre and userbooks
